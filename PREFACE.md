# Linux Distro Base Map

This project is an attempt to build a database of Debian/Ubuntu based
distros and the versions the are based on.
The idea is to have this data available in a machine-readable form in
order to process meta data about distros in software.
The data is available as JSON data files in the `data` directory.
A script is used to generate the human-readable form as seen below.

If you want to contribute update data or add support for a distro not
yet listed here, please read [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md).
